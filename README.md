# Resume classification using Naive Bayes.
Companies often receive thousands of resumes for each job posting and employ dedicated screening officers to screen qualified candidates. Finding suitable candidates for an open role from a database of 1000s of resumes can be a tough task. Automated resume categorization can speeden the candidate selection process. Such automation can really ease the tedious process of fair screening and shortlisting the right candidates and aid quick decision-making.

# Credit risk modelling using Logistic Regression
Credit risk arises when a corporate or individual borrower fails to meet their debt obligations. From the lender's perspective, credit risk could disrupt its cash flows or increase collection costs, since the lender may be forced to hire a debt collection agency to enforce the collection. The loss may be partial or complete, where the lender incurs a loss of part of the loan or the entire loan extended to the borrower.

Credit scoring algorithms, which calculate the probability of default, are the best methods that banks use to determine whether or not a loan should be granted.

# Speech Emotion Classification
Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is the task of recognizing the emotion from speech, irrespective of the semantics. Humans can efficiently perform this task as a natural part of speech communication, however, the ability to conduct it automatically using programmable devices is a field of active research.

Studies of automatic emotion recognition systems aim to create efficient, real-time methods of detecting the emotions of mobile phone users, call centre operators and customers, car drivers, pilots, and many other human-machine communication users. Adding emotions to machines forms an important aspect of making machines appear and act in a human-like manner

# Employee Attrition Prediction
Employee attrition is the gradual reduction in employee numbers. Employee attrition happens when the size of your workforce diminishes over time. This means that employees are leaving faster than they are hired. Employee attrition happens when employees retire, resign, or simply aren't replaced. Although employee attrition can be company-wide, it may also be confined to specific parts of a business.

Employee attrition can happen for several reasons. These include unhappiness about employee benefits or the pay structure, a lack of employee development opportunities, and even poor conditions in the workplace.

# Customer segmentation using clustering
In Retail and E-Commerce (B2C), and more broadly in B2B, one of the key elements shaping the business strategy of a firm is understanding of customer behaviour. More specifically, understanding the customers based on different business metrics: how much they spend (revenue), how often they spend (frequency), are they new or existing customers, what are their favorite products, etc... Such understanding in turn helps direct marketing, sales, account management and product teams to support customers on a personalized level and improve the product offering.

Furthermore, segmenting customers into different categories based on similar/cyclical buying pattern over a period of 1 year helps the retail shops manage their inventory better, thereby lowering costs and raising revenues by placing the orders in sync with the buying cycles.

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:
